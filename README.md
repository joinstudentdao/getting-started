# About Student DAO

Student DAO provides all students with an interest in web3 the opportunity to learn, connect, earn, apply, and govern their own community, so that they are prepared for whatâ€™s next. 

We're launching the first DAO exclusively for university or graduate students, and providing valuable resources to students for free:
* Networking with thousands of other like minded students (find a co-founder or frens)
* Evergreen content, knowledge, and resources (enables clubs without resources to thrive)
* Exclusive speakers and lecturers from top protocols and funds
* Exclusive job boards for the hottest web3 companies
* Exclusive events and hackathons
* Hands on experience for DAO membership and treasury management (revenue share)
* Manage grants and investments
* Scholarships from treasury
* Mentor program

For partners, we're providing protocols and funds paid access to:
* Next generation of web3 talent - post jobs / search
* User/developer acquisition strategy (ie tutorial upload for building dapps, etc..)
